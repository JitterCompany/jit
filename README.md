# jit
jit[ter] journal script: quickly write a timestamped,  tagged log entry.

## Installation

No installation required, except that you may want to add the jit command to your `$PATH` variable.
How this works depends on your platform. On linux, you should place this snippet in your `~/.bashrc` file:

```
export PATH=$PATH:~/path/to/jit/                                    
```
